# Collective Human Opinions in Semantic Textual Similarity
This work explores collective human opinions in Semantic Textual Similarity, with a new uncertainty-aware STS dataset, USTS released.
USTS is split into two subsets: USTS-U and USTS-C by the degree of annotation disagreement between raters. 
USTS-C has higher human disagreement than USTS-U. Chinese text, raw annotations and average similarity score can be found in ./data/ustsc and ./data/ustsu, with clear split for training, development and test sets.
We additionally provide multilingual USTS with other languages, such as English, Arabic, German, Japanese and etc., and note that the raw annotations are labelled based on the Chinese sentence pairs.
